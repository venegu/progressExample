# progressExample
Example use of a progress bar to show download progress with Swift based off the following [resource](http://www.devfright.com/ios-data-download-progress-bar-tutorial/) written in Objective-C (there was no Swift example on the interwebs).

It currently __does not support iOS 9.0__ and will need to be updated to use `NSURLSession` instead of `NSURLConnection`.
